# Keybinds

Everything in the main view is remappable in `~/.config/vorgan/config.toml`
(an action name can take one key or a list). The Graph screen keys are fixed.
The same actions are in the toolbar and the right-click menu.

## Remapping

```toml
# ~/.config/vorgan/config.toml

```

Remappable action names: `down up enter back top bottom graph hint search hidden pin warp toggle
